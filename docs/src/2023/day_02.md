# Day two

For day two of advent of code, we arrive at Snow Island. We walk a bit with an elf and play a game. The elf will show us some red, green and blue cubes and we have to tell which games were possible.

## Part one

For the first part, we are given an example input and need to fins out which games were possible with 12 red, 13 green, and 14 blue cubes. Let's start and write a test for that.
