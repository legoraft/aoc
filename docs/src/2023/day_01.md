# Day one

## Part one

For the first part of the first day of advent of code 2023, you need to find a calibration value within a line of text, grabbing only the first and last number in that line of text. These two numbers have to be concatenated and form a two digit number together. By adding up all these numbers, you find your calibration value.

I started by just creating a simple test to check if the example input equals the example answer. With this I can check if my code is correct for the example, so I can use it on my true input.
