# Advent of code

I am trying to learn rust by doing some advent of code projects, which challenge you to solve simple and complex problems in any programming language. Check advent of code out [here](https://adventofcode.com).

## Info

I create a new rust project for every day and each year is organized in a subfolder. All my thought processes and my solution explanations are also written at at [legoraft.github.io/aoc](https://legoraft.github.io/aoc).
