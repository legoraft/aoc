# Advent of code

I am trying to learn rust by doing some advent of code projects, which challenge you to solve simple and complex problems in any programming language. Check advent of code out [here](https://adventofcode.com). This repo also is a small training into documenting all my thought processes and code, so you can understand it later, even though you've never read it. This documentation is available on [my site](https://legoraft.github.io/aoc)

## Info

I create a new rust project for every day and each year is organized in a subfolder. If you just want to solve a certain problem, put an input file for a certain day into `/<year>/inputs/<day_number>.txt`. To run the day, `cd` into the day folder and just run `cargo run`. Make sure your day file is formatted with `01` if it is a single digit day.
