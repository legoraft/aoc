# Advent of code

These are my solutions for the advent of code, all written in rust. I'm still learning rust, so the solutions won't be as elegant or well-designed as some other people will do.

## Info

Every year is labeled with words, so 2023, converted to '23, will be `twenty_three`. This is due to the fact that rust needs words in crates and this is the cleanest way to do so in my opinion.
