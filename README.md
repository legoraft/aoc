# Advent of code

These are my solutions for the advent of code, all written in rust. I'm still learning rust, so the solutions won't be as elegant or well-designed as some other people will do.

## Info

Every year is a separate rust project, and every day is it's own module. The problems will be solved in functions and there are be written test cases for the example problems. Enjoy my solutions!
